MONOTEST Build Instructions
===========================

This project uses a standard Makefile for building.

Prerequisites
-------------
- GCC (g++) supporting C++11
- Make
- standard Linux headers (for X11 and dlfcn)

One-Liner
---------
    make

Build Options
-------------

### 1. Platforms
By default, the build targets generic `x86-64`. You can optimize for modern CPUs (AVX2, etc.) using:

    make platform=modernx11

Supported platforms:
- `x11` (default, march=x86-64)
- `modernx11` (march=x86-64-v3)

### 2. Output Mode
You can create a standalone distribution folder containing the binaries and assets:

    make dist

This creates a `dist/` directory.

### 3. Strict Mode
To enable strict warning checks (`-Wall -Wextra`), pass `strict=1`:

    make strict=1

### 4. Build Targets
You can choose to build only specific components. This is useful for hot-reloading (rebuilding just the game logic) or engine development.

    make build=game     # Builds bin/game.so
    make build=engine   # Builds bin/monotest
    make                # Builds both (default)

Examples
--------
Build optimized game logic only (fast iteration):
    make build=game platform=modernx11

Full strict distribution build:
    make dist strict=1 platform=modernx11
